# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The XLBiz.AI Incident Automation Agent is a lightweight, enterprise-grade solution designed to eliminate operational inefficiencies by automating incident detection, classification, and response workflows. The system integrates AI-powered classification with multi-platform integrations including Slack, Jira, and knowledge base search to provide intelligent incident management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to receive incident alerts through a REST API endpoint, so that external monitoring systems can automatically trigger incident processing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external system sends a POST request to `/api/incidents/trigger` with valid JSON payload THEN the system SHALL accept and process the incident
2. WHEN the incident payload contains required fields (id, type, description, source, timestamp) THEN the system SHALL validate and store the incident
3. WHEN the incident payload is malformed or missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation errors
4. WHEN the system successfully receives an incident THEN it SHALL return HTTP 202 with incident ID for tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want AI to automatically classify incident severity and generate remediation suggestions, so that my team can prioritize and resolve issues more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an incident is received THEN the AI service SHALL classify severity as Low, Medium, or High based on incident details
2. WHEN classifying severity THEN the AI SHALL consider incident type, description, affected users, and environment metadata
3. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the AI SHALL query the knowledge base for relevant solutions and best practices
4. WHEN AI processing completes THEN the system SHALL store both classification reasoning and remediation suggestions
5. IF AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL assign default severity and continue processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want automatic Slack channel creation and stakeholder notifications for incidents, so that response teams can collaborate effectively in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Medium or High severity incident is processed THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated Slack channel with format #incident-{id}
2. WHEN creating Slack channels THEN the system SHALL post formatted incident summary with AI suggestions
3. WHEN posting to Slack THEN the system SHALL invite configured stakeholders based on incident type and severity
4. WHEN Slack integration fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with other integrations
5. WHEN incident status updates THEN the system SHALL post updates to the incident channel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want automatic Jira ticket creation for incidents, so that issues are tracked and managed through our existing workflow processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an incident is processed THEN the system SHALL create a Jira ticket with incident details
2. WHEN creating Jira tickets THEN the system SHALL map incident severity to appropriate Jira priority levels
3. WHEN populating ticket fields THEN the system SHALL include incident description, AI suggestions, and metadata
4. WHEN assigning tickets THEN the system SHALL use configured project key and component mappings
5. IF Jira integration fails THEN the system SHALL store ticket creation request for retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want incident data stored in a database with full audit trail, so that we can analyze patterns and improve our incident response processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an incident is received THEN the system SHALL persist all incident data to the database
2. WHEN storing incidents THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, AI analysis results, and integration status
3. WHEN updating incident status THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of all changes
4. WHEN querying incidents THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date, severity, type, and status
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide incident statistics and metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a support engineer, I want to query incident status and history through API endpoints, so that I can track incident progress and retrieve historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting incident status via GET `/api/incidents/{id}/status` THEN the system SHALL return current status and processing details
2. WHEN listing incidents via GET `/api/incidents` THEN the system SHALL support pagination and filtering parameters
3. WHEN requesting incident statistics via GET `/api/incidents/stats` THEN the system SHALL return dashboard metrics
4. WHEN accessing incident data THEN the system SHALL include AI analysis results and integration status
5. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with error details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a knowledge manager, I want a vector-based knowledge base that learns from incident patterns, so that AI suggestions become more accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize vector database with predefined incident patterns
2. WHEN processing incidents THEN the AI SHALL query knowledge base for similar patterns and solutions
3. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the system SHALL rank solutions by relevance and confidence scores
4. WHEN incidents are resolved THEN the system SHALL update knowledge base with successful resolution patterns
5. WHEN knowledge base is queried THEN it SHALL return top 3 most relevant solutions with confidence scores

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive configuration management for all integrations, so that the system can be deployed across different environments securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all sensitive configuration SHALL be externalized through environment variables
2. WHEN configuring integrations THEN the system SHALL validate API credentials and permissions on startup
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
4. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations
5. WHEN handling API keys THEN the system SHALL never log or expose sensitive credentials

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want robust error handling and monitoring capabilities, so that the system remains reliable and observable in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any integration fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing with graceful degradation
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
3. WHEN processing incidents THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN it SHALL provide health endpoints for monitoring
5. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL include metrics and tracing capabilities
